### Spoilers

Read no further unless you want to see solutions for the "maze" in this game!
























1. The player must collect three coins and throw them into the fountain to make a key appear.
   * A sign near the fountain tells the player "three wishes in this well are the key to success"
1. One coin can be found by watching a fish video and answering questions.
   * A sign indicates "a sharp eye is often paid quite well"
1. One coin can be found by spelling out the word "Bananas" next to the banana tree.
   * A sign indicates that "the obvious is often spelled out by running the right way"
   * In this area, the user must gaze at the right letter in order.
1. One coin can be found by releasing all but the blue balloons.
   * A sign indicates that "wishful thinking is never blue"
   * Here, the user releases one of many balloons by starting at them.
1. A view from the "penthouse" will let a player get a quick cheat sheet if they look
   at the roof of the main temple building.
